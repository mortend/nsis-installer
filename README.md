> The new Windows installer for Fuse Studio 2.0.

## Introduction

An NSIS installer that uses Node.js and NPM to install its payload(s), and that automatically detects or installs missing dependencies, such as:

* Git for Windows
* Node.js
* VC++ redistributables

The source code is provided as an example for other Node.js-powered apps that may need a GUI-based installer for Windows.
